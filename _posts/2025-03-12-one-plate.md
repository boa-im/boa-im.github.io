## Introduction
---
Worked as: **Full Stack Develeoper**   

I decided to develop this app because following 2 reasons:

1. Customers' No-show Problem
One of the critical problems is that a customer called to the restaurant to make a takeout order.
When the order is ready to pickup, the customer needs to come to the restuarant and pay to pick up.
But a few of customers doesn't show up and get calls from us.

2. Order Mistake
When I get an order from dine-in custoemrs or call, I need to enter them into POS system.
Becasue I am a human, I sometimes make a mistake.
For example, a customer order a fried egg on the side, I could miss this.

I wanted to decrease these situations.
We are developing a 2 web app for Customers and Merchants.

Once the partner login, the partner doesn't need to login again until the refresh token expires.
After login, the partner is redirected to homepage with all the restaurants list operated by the partner.
All restaurants images are called from server not the database.
Partners can click the 'Star' icon to make a restaurant as a active restaurant to secure other restuarants' info from the one restaurant employees.

#### Add a restaurant

A partner can add a restaurant by entering all information of the restaurant.
TBD: Make it to send an email to Customer Service to verify if the restaurant is exist.
