## Introduction
---
Worked as: **Full Stack Develeoper**   

I decided to develop this app because following 2 reasons:

1. Customers' No-show Problem
One of the critical problems is that a customer called to the restaurant to make a takeout order.
When the order is ready to pickup, the customer needs to come to the restuarant and pay to pick up.
But a few of customers doesn't show up and get calls from us.

2. Order Mistake
When I get an order from dine-in custoemrs or call, I need to enter them into POS system.
Becasue I am a human, I sometimes make a mistake.
For example, a customer order a fried egg on the side, I could miss this.

I wanted to decrease these situations.
We are developing a 2 web app for Customers and Merchants.
