- [ ] Solved

## Description
---
You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**   
> Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]   
> Output: true   
> Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

**Example 2:**   
> Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]   
> Output: false   
> Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
 
**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 105

## My Solution = Best Solution
---
```shell
public class Solution {
    public bool CanJump(int[] nums) {
        int goal = nums.Length - 1;

        for(int i = nums.Length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (i + nums[i] >= goal) {
                goal = i;
            }
        }

        return goal == 0;
    }
}
```
