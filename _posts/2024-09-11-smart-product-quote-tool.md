## Conclusion
---
It was my first hackathon!!! And we ranked on the final list (**Top 7%**)üèÜ!!!

I faced so many difficult situation. For example, after my team decided to use C# ASP.NET framework to develop this website, one of my teammates kept saying she has never learned C# before. So, my teammates and I told her we can study together. But on the first day, she said 'I want to give up this hackathon because I can't follow you'. I noticed that I gave her some hard task. So I re-assigned the tasks which are suitable for each level as a leader. So finally she could do her task and also my teammates and I did very well. I think this is why we racked on the final list because we did great job!

And it was really impressing experience to watch the winners' presentations. I could learn how to introduce my project's strength and how to promote my project.   
1. Compare with competitors
: By researching the existing apps, I can share the reason I wanted to make this project.
2. SWOT Analysis
: It is really powerful to get fund from investors.
3. Impressing Demo
: I don't have to show all the features of my project. Just show the main feature that I want to emphasize.

If I have a chance to present my project, I will definitely follow their flow.
