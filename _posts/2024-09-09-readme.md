Hello, my name is Boa and welcome to my blog!

This blog is to upload posts about my projects, and the process of my study.

I recently completed my diploma in **Computer Programming and Analysis** from **Conestoga College**.
After graduation, I was looking for ways to show my awesome projects efficiently with images
because just a one page of resume cannot include every story that I want to share.

And, as a driven software developer, I want to share what and how I am studying.
There are a lot of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and platforms that I want to learn.

I will post everything for junior developers like me :) Let's study together!   
I hope this blog will help not only myself but also others!

You can also see my resume by clicking the file icon at the bottom left.   
Feel free to reach me out via email **boa.im0101@gmail.com**.
