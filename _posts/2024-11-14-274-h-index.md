## Description
---
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return the *researcher's h-index*.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

 

**Example 1:**   
> Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]   
> Output: 3   
> Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.   
> Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**   
> Input: citations = [1,3,1]   
> Output: 1
 
**Constraints:**
- n == citations.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

## My Solution
---
```shell
public class Solution {
    public int HIndex(int[] citations) {
        int h = 0;
        int[] numsCitation = new int[citations.Length + 1];

        for(int i = 0; i < citations.Length; i++) {
            if(citations[i] > citations.Length) {
                numsCitation[citations.Length]++;
            }
            else {
                numsCitation[citations[i]]++;
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = citations.Length; i >= 0; i--) {
            h += numsCitation[i];

            if(h == i) {
                return h;
            }
            else if (h > i) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```
